      <h2 class="flow-text">About Your Budget Plan</h2>

      <p class="flow-text">This budget plan is designed for simplicity, so there are only three categories that you need
        to plan: Income,
        Flex Expenses, and Firm Expenses!</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="flow-text"><span class="material-icons">
            monetization_on
          </span> Income - Any source of money the you gain falls into this category, whether it be your paycheck or a
          gift</li>
        <li class="flow-text"><span class="material-icons">
            add_shopping_cart
          </span>Flex Expenses - These are any expenses which you change from month to month. This category includes
          grocery
          shopping, restaurants, clothing,
          movies, travel, gas, and anything else that you spend a varying amount of money on. We place this all in one
          category to give you a greater understanding
          of how much your actually spending and to provide greater flexibility for everything life throws your way.
          This
          is the expense category that you'll want to keep
          a closer eye on during the month!
        </li>
        <li class="flow-text"><span class="material-icons">
            house
          </span>Firm Expenses - These are any expenses that remain the same from month to month. This category includes
          your
          rent or mortgage, health insurance, car payments,
          a monthly cleaning service with set fees, your phone bill, internet, electricity. There's not much that will
          change these bills on a month to month basis, so we throw
          them into your firm expenses.
