## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
SimplyBudget is an answer to the crowd of complicated budgeting apps which make the process of budgeting overwhelming and over-categorized. Rather than tracking each minute category, from your laundry fees to your 
'fun money', this app helps you track three main categories: your income, your flex expenses, and your firm expenses. 

* Income : Any incoming money to your account, whether it be from a job or a gift
* Firm Expenses: Stable expenses that have to be paid and which remain the same from month to month. This may include your rent or mortgage, your health insurance, your phone bill. Think of it as your 'automated expenses' that you don't have much control over. 
* Flex Expenses: Fluid expenses that you have more control over, even if they are necessary purchases like groceries. This category encompasses any purchases that make at a grocery store, restaurant, Target, or yard sale.

By separating expenses into your steady monthly expenses and controllable monthly expenses, you can gain realistic insights on what your monthly budget should look like while still retaining the flexibility to buy your sister a birthday fit without maxing out an overly-specfied category. Welcome to more reasonable and stress-free budgeting!
